origin :- refers to source repo from which it was cloned
master :- is default local branch in git

git pull origin master
	:- will pull changes from the origine remote's master branch and merge them to local checkout-branch


git fetch :- it will only downloads new data from origin. it will not merge into the local master
	     repository. it is harmless

	     whereas git pull command download the changes and merge it to local repository
	     
git branch :- it essentially create new copy of master branch. 
		usefulness of branch


git checkout :- swifting one branch to another branch
		Head pointer will move to second branch


		working area
		stagging area (via git add . )
		commit area (via git commit -m)

		this can be done in single step using command
		git commit -am 'message'
		{ git has ability to consolidate multiple changes in multiple file with a single commit.
		  this is done by use of index data structure }

git push origin <branch name> :- it will push changes to origin branch.


git log :- 

git diff :- show files changes in your working directory with respect to the current
		branch in your local repo.

git status :-	shows the staged, unstaged, untracked files




scenario 1 :- suppose your git repository has a branch name test and you have cloned the master branch
		git checkout -b test origin/test
		when you push it gives you error nonfastforward error !!!!
		someone else has made changes to the code in the test branch after you checkedout
			do git pull
			but there is possibility of code conflict with local changes.
			console will list that
